# CI CD using Jenkins

    Introduction
    Concepts
        - Continuous Integration
        - Continuous Delivery (deployable code)
        - Continuous Deployment (Automated deployment to Prod)
    Jenkins Installation and Configuration
    Plugins
    Sample Job creation
    Build triggers
    Upstream / Downstream projects
    Paramerized builds (Pass variables to your jobs at runtime)
    Distributed builds ("Master/worker" or "Build Slave" architecture)
        Why Distributed Builds?
        - distrinute the load
        - Parallel execution
        - different OS / Platforms / Environments
    Pipelines --> (Pipeline-as-Code)



Source Code ----> Build ---> Test ---> Deploy to Pre-Prod (Staging) ---> Deploy to Prod

CI Job ---> UAT test job ---> deploy Job ---> Notifications

dev --> test --> Staging --> prod

## Java Build Tools
    - Ant       - build.xml
    - Maven     - pom.xml
    - Gradle    - build.xml
